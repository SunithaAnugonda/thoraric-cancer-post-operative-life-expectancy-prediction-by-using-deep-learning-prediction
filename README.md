Thoracic cancer surgery is an important medical intervention that has a significant impact on patientsâ€™ postoperative care survival. 
Predicting postoperative outcomes can help physicians make informed decisions and develop individualized care plans. 
The methodology encompasses the preprocessing of Thoracic Surgery data, including augmentation with noise and shuffling, encoding of categorical variables, and reshaping of the data to facilitate effective model training. 
Building an LSTM model for binary categorization of postoperative outcomes forms the basis of the methodology. 
Data augmentation enhances model robustness, while preprocessing ensures data compatibility. 
The model is put through a rigorous training process, and its performance is assessed by the visualization of training data. 
The study's focus on postoperative life expectancy prediction, which captures temporal dependencies essential for comprehending recovery dynamics, advances medical deep learning. 
Generalization across patient profiles is improved by combining categorical variable encoding with noise augmentation. 
Results could aid clinicians in assessing postoperative prognosis, informing personalized patient care strategies. 
The methodology described here provides a foundation for further deep learning-based medical predictive modeling research. 
The process includes data augmentation, preprocessing, model construction, training, visualization, and evaluation achieving an accuracy of approximately 92.96%.
